# Open Kick-Off

Open Kick-Off is a fun rewriting attempt of the cult football game *Kick Off 2* designed by Dino Dini ([@dndn1011](https://twitter.com/dndn1011)) with sprite outwork supplied by Steve Screech [(@Steve_Screech)](https://twitter.com/steve_screech) and released by Anco for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga in 1990. It is written in Java with the help of [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

Goals of this project are simply to have fun while learning new things about all the software technologies involved.
